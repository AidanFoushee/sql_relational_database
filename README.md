# Overview

I decided to learn more about SQL relational databases and explore what you can do with them. I have discovered just how useful they can be and I have grown a lot from learning to use them.

The software I wrote is intended for a Bishop to use to help manage their ward members. They are able to add members to their ward, update callings of the members, display the ward, sort the ward by gender and by age, and also delete members.

I wanted to further my learning about databases and discover why SQL relational databases are a powerful tool.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running, a walkthrough of the code, and a view of how created the Relational Database.}
